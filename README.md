Assignment Synopsis:   

Granger's Causality Test and the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model are two time series analysis techniques that seem to be used in the notebook that the professor gave us to forecast the prices of gold and oil. Based on data on gold, silver, and crude oil prices as well as stock indexes, interest rates, and USD rates, it seeks to forecast future prices for these commodities.
